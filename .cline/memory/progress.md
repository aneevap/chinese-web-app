# Progress

## Completed

### Session 1 — Bug Fixes
- Fixed image garbage collection and rating formula in `study.html`
- Fixed position persistence on revisit in `write.html`

### Session 2 — Data Consolidation
- Removed duplicate JSON files, updated paths in `vite.config.ts` and `vocab.ts`

### Session 3 & 4 — UI Standardization (Phase 2)
- Migrated `index.html` and `new-learner.html` to `shared/design-system.css`
- Updated `dojo.html` and `progress.html` with design system variables
- Applied paper-grain textures, ink tones, and shadow tokens

### Session 5 — Memory Bank
- Initialized Memory Bank documentation structure

### Session 6 — Supabase Integration
- Created `supabase-schema.sql` — 4 tables (profiles, scores, mastery, items) with RLS policies
- Created `shared/supabase-client.js` — Supabase init via CDN with anonymous auth
- Created `shared/supabase-sync.js` — push/pull/merge sync service with pending write queue
- Modified `profiles.js` — `_triggerSync()` hooks on every write operation
- Added supabase scripts to all 7 pages (index, new-learner, study, write, dojo, progress, print)
- Fixed pending write queue (writes during sync init were silently dropped)

### Session 7 — write.html UI Standardization & Bug Fix
- Migrated `write.html` to design system (paper-grain bg, design variables, fonts)
- Preserved all HanziWriter functionality
- Fixed `currentTheme=0` bug (initialized to 0, matching first theme index → `selectTheme(0)` exited early skipping `buildWordList()` and `loadChar(0)`)
